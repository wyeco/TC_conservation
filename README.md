Global tree species' range maps generated via alpha-hull methods (download the three zipped files and put them in the same folder, then unzip by selecting any one of them. They can also be downloaded via https://zenodo.org/records/10212050), and statistical codes. 


In addition, a derived dataset summarizing the used occurrence records from 2,070 datasets in GBIF can be viewed and accessed via https://doi.org/10.15468/dd.4jvnmv.
